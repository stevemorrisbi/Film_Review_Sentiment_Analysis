# Film Review Sentiment Analysis
Finding the sentiment of film reviews from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and then using the highest average sentiment score to decide what film to watch. 

Future Development: 
 - The project uses BERT from Google as its model but there are other options to experiment with such as XLNet.
 - Collect a larger list of films to compare.
 - Option to input genre as a parameter to search for and then pick out the highest scoring film in that genre.
 - The first collection of reviews are used in the scraping but this is not exhaustive of what is available. More advanced scraping would be needed in order to loop through pages to collect all the reviews of a particular film.
